# Exercise 1.4

Which of the following  strings are
valid identifiers?

```
___  _end  End  end  until?  nil NULL
```

Identifiers in Lua can be composed of English
letters (a-z and A-Z), underscores (_) and
digits (0-9), however they may not start with
a digit. Also, in order to be valid, they must
not be one of the reserved identifiers.

- `until?`: Nope, question marks are not allowed.")
- `end` and `nil`: Nope, reserved keyword.
- Others are valid.
